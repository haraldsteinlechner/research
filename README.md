**Attribute Grammars for Incremental Evaluation of Scene Graph Semantics**
========
Three dimensional scenes are typically structured in a hierarchical way. 
This leads to scene graphs as a common central structure for the representation of virtual content. 
Although the concept of scene graphs is versatile and powerful, it has severe drawbacks.
Firstly, due to its hierarchical nature the communication between related nodes is cumbersome.
Secondly, changes in the virtual content make it necessary to traverse the whole scene graph at each frame. 
Although caching mechanisms for scene graphs have been proposed, none of them work for dynamic 
scenes with arbitrary changes.
Thirdly, state-of-the-art scene graph systems are limited in terms of extensibility.
Extending framework code with new node types usually requires the users to modify traversals and
the implementations of other nodes.
In this work, we use *attribute grammars* as underlying mechanism for specifying
scene graph semantics. 
We propose an embedded domain specific language for specifying scene graph semantics,
which elegantly solves the extensibility problem.
Attribute grammars provide well-founded mechanisms for communication between related nodes and
significantly reduce glue code for composing scene graph semantics.
The declarative nature of attribute grammars allows for side-effect free formulation
of scene graph semantics, which gives raise for incremental evaluation.

In contrast to previous work we use an expressive computation model for attribute grammar evaluation
which handles fully dynamic scene graph semantics while allowing for efficient *incremental evaluation*.

We introduce all necessary mechanisms for integrating incremental scene graph 
semantics with traditional rendering backends.
In our evaluation we show reduced development effort for standard scene graph
nodes. In addition to optimality proofs we show that our system is indeed
incremental and outperforms traditional scene graph systems in dynamic scenes.
